## Why

It's a good question — why did I need to roll my own state management library?

First of all, I didn't need to and other options may very well better suit your needs

But, since you asked:
- 🐣 it's tiny (~⅕kB last time I checked) 
- 🔤 it's simple (one class whose instances surface only two methods)
- 🚀 it's op af (caveat being that there's no hand-holding whatsoever)
