## Why

It's a good question â€” why did I need to roll my own state management library?

First of all, I didn't need to and other options may very well better suit your needs

But, since you asked:
- :hatching_chick: it's tiny (~.5kB last time I checked) 
- :abc: it's simple (one class whose instances surface only two methods)
- :rocket: it's op af (caveat being that there's no hand-holding whatsoever)
